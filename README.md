SmartMe is a Java-based card matching game designed to test players' memory skills. The game aims to provide an engaging and challenging experience by progressively increasing the difficulty level. Players are required to match cards based on their attributes, such as color, shape, or symbol, within a time limit.



# Game Logic Implementation:
The game logic component is responsible for managing the core gameplay procedure. It includes functions such as generating cards, tracking the time, handling card selections and matches, and determining the game's outcome (win or lose). The following steps the implementation details of the game logic:
A - Card Generation: The game logic generates a set of cards with various Characters pictures
B- Timer: The game logic tracks the time elapsed from the start of the game. It updates the timer display on the game interface and checks if the time limit for each level has been exceeded.
C- Card Selection: The player can select two cards at a time. The game logic should handle the selection, track the selected cards, and compare their attributes to determine if they are a match OR not .
D- Matching Process: The game logic should include tools to compare the selected cards and determine if they match based on their pictures . If the cards match, they should be removed from the game board. Otherwise, they should be flipped back to their original state.
E- Game Outcome: The game logic determines the outcome of the game, whether the player has won or lost. This can be based on factors such as successfully matching all the cards within the time limit.
